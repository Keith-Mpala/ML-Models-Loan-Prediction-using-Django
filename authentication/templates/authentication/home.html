        <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">What is machine learning in Banking ?</h1>
        <p class="container">
            In the field of banking, machine learning technology can be utilized to extract practical and valuable insights from the vast amount of data
            that banks collect. This data includes transaction history, conversations with bank representatives, and corporate documents. With the help of
            machine learning models, banks can effectively process and analyze this information to gain deeper insights into their customers and internal 
            operations. By incorporating machine learning in their operations, banks can improve their fraud detection capabilities, enhance credit underwriting
            processes, comply with regulatory requirements, and boost customer engagement.

        <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Reduced costs</li>
        <p>* Automation of back-office operations and speed up document processing workflow.</p>

        <p>* Identify patterns in customer behavior, enable deeper understanding of customer needs, and help create a highly personalized service offerings.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Enhance risk management</li>
        <p>* Machine learning algorithms are able to model how a bank will react to certain economic conditions and this allows decision makers to create more informed strategies.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Improved fraud prevention</li>
        <p>* Machine learning allows banks to proactively monitor customer behavior, identify anomalies in real time, reduce the probability of false positives, and prevent fraud. </p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;"> Accelerated decision-making</li>
        <p>* Given that machine learning can process huge amounts of data much faster and more accurately than humans, banks can use ML- generated insights to make important decisions more frequently and with fewer risks.</p>

        <h3 class="center" style="font-weight: bold;"> Using Machine learning algorthim to Predict status of a Loan.</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Here, we use the most famous dataset to <em><strong>Predict Loan Status</strong></em> of an already existing applicant. We build a 
            machine learning model, perfom training and validation tests to reduce bias of the model. The model predict whether an applicant 
            is able to Fully Pay their loan or they will Default.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Credit Underwriter feeds the ML - model with details of an existing applicant and the output of the model is a classification label of 
            whether a loan will be <em><strong>Fully Paid</strong></em> or <em><strong>Charged Off (Default)</strong></em>.

        <p>* Implementation steps in building a reliale maching learning model</p>
        <h5><em><strong>Step 1: Identify your business case</strong></em></h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Before deciding of ML model to build, there is need to clearly identify strategic business goals and assess how machine learning can be 
            used to help an organization to achieve these goals. 
        </p>
        <h5><em><strong>Step 2: Prepare your data</strong></em></h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Insights derived from machine learning are as good as the data used in the process. Data quality is therefore pivotal in developing reliable
            machine learning tools.
            </p>
        <h5><em><strong>Step 3: Understand your algorithm</strong></em></h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Selecting the most suitable machine learning methodology and type of algorithms bring the most value. There is also need to fully understand 
            bias of an algorithm and work toward minimizing its effect.
